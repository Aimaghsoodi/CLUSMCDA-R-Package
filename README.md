# CLUSMCDA-R-Package
This package is a part of the CLUS-MCDA project developed by Abteen Ijadi Maghsoodi. This package is a runnable package with no need to define any dependencies and it will ask the user the required information/input-data as you load the library and start the algorithm, this package has been coded by Dara Riahi and developed by Abteen Ijadi Maghsoodi.  CLUS-MCDA (Cluster analysis for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) algorithm is an iterative methodology based on the K-means clustering technique combined with the Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis plus the full MULTIplicative form (MULTIMOORA) developed by Ijadi Maghsoodi et al. [1]. In this update the CLUS-MCDA approach has been utilized with Parallel Decision Making (PDM), Multi-Scenario Structure and the use of attributes weights, in case a user needed any of these calculating options.
